<h2 class="log" style="line-height: 6px;">Building My First Simple Calculator</h2>
<p class="date">January 2026</p>
<p>
Building my first simple calculator was one of the most exciting projects
in my web development learning journey. It helped me understand how HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript work together to create an interactive web application.
</p>
<br>
<h2 class="log">Project Overview</h2>
<p>
The goal of this project was to create a basic calculator that can perform
simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division. The calculator includes buttons for numbers, operators, and
a display area to show the results.
</p>
<br>
<h2 class="log">Technologies Used</h2>
<ul class="skill">
  <li>HTML - to structure the calculator layout</li>
  <li>CSS - to style the buttons and align the layout</li>
  <li>JavaScript - to handle logic and user interactions</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2 class="log">Challenges I Faced</h2>
<p>
One of the main challenges was handling button clicks and ensuring that
the correct values were displayed on the screen. I also had to think
carefully about how to store user input and perform calculations accurately.
</p>
<br>
<h2 class="log">What I Learned</h2>
<ul class="skill">
  <li>How to use JavaScript event listeners</li>
  <li>Basic DOM manipulation</li>
  <li>Writing simple and readable JavaScript logic</li>
  <li>Debugging small errors in code</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2 class="log">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
This project boosted my confidence and motivated me to continue building
more projects. It showed me how small ideas can turn into working
applications with consistent practice and learning.
